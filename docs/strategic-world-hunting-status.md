# UFO hunting and escort integration

Branch 4c. Pinned reference: 4df3a5e571a1a4b5e8a46d3161fb2e21a2adba15.

The strategic-hunting capture inserts Craft::getHunterKillerAttraction,
Ufo::insideRadarRange and GeoscapeState::ufoHuntingAndEscorting's selection
fragment verbatim. Controlled collaborators supply effective capacities, craft
eligibility and distances. Ninety-six attraction rows and fourteen selection
rows pin both hunt modes, strict saved-order comparisons, original-target ties,
ignored/undetectable exclusions, zero radar and inclusive range.

The gameplay-owned selection operation preserves those rules. Arithmetic outside
signed 32-bit range and zero divisors fail intentionally. Captured outputs and
malformed inputs have focused compatibility tests. The retarget and integration slices below connect the operation to loaded actors.
Combat remains branch 5; branch 4d is untouched and the headless gate remains open.

The retarget slice adds reference destination backup, hunt speed, escort speed and
waypoint restoration operations. Captured transitions retain the original waypoint
across hunt-to-escort changes and leave speed unchanged on restoration. Explicit
selected speed controls the five-second/one-minute fast path; ten-minute retargeting
is always due. Mod::hunterKillerFastRetarget defaults true and survives fresh/cache
projection. The redundant-HK-alert option defaults true, honors fixed user options
and persists through the save adapter. Compiler revision 33 invalidates stale caches.
The option and transition fixtures cover fresh/cache projection and reload;
the live integration is described below.

Live imported hunters and escorts now use registered ten-minute retargeting after
base hunting, plus the explicit slow-speed fast path before five-second movement.
Retargeting honors projected fuel returns, preserves original waypoints, allocates
contact markers and publishes gameplay-owned hunt notifications. Alert suppression
does not prevent revelation or targeting. Movement follows craft/UFO positions in
reference list order; snapshot capture resolves final target coordinates without
changing movement. Deleted escort targets restore their original waypoint.

Combat arrivals stop atomically before mutation. Retargeting involving same-tick
grounded auto-patrol relaunches or airborne craft transfers retains specific
forecast guards. Escort chains/cycles and malformed originals fail intentionally.
Deletion scans are bounded before nested work. Grounded non-escort waves and
airborne non-escort waves with no possible craft target execute through the
constructor/spawn slices below. Creation-time escorts and candidate-bearing
airborne waves retain their atomic forecast boundary.
The headless gate remains open and branch 4d is untouched.

The three-slice batch audit reproduced a same-tick boundary bypass: a hunter's
new revelation was absent from an imported pursuer's craft-arrival forecast.
Craft interception checks now use the retarget projection before any mutation.
Regression tests also reject signed 32-bit intermediate attraction overflow even
when later terms would produce an in-range result; each C++ operation is bounded.
The root allocation gate caught eager closure allocation in the escort forecast
on ordinary flight. An explicit identity scan removes that allocation, preserving
the existing 8/32/128-UFO budgets. Handler-order assertions include both registered
retarget callers without weakening their exact ordering.

Final cycle validation passes all 1,692 root tests with no failures or skips,
including fixture checksums, all 19 staged-save classifications, 72-hour composed
scenarios and populated allocation budgets. Formatting verification, code-map
validation and diff checks pass. The pinned C++ checkout remains clean; obsolete
probe object output was removed. Branch 4c remains incomplete and 4d is untouched.

Hunter constructor initialization is now an executable gameplay operation.
The pinned Ufo constructor capture has 192 rows covering nonpositive percentages,
failed/successful rolls, percentages above 100, literal modes/behaviors and the
ordered optional random selections. Failed rolls consume no mode/behavior draws;
nonpositive percentages consume no RNG. Supply objective callers retain the
reference constructor defaults. Positive hunter spawning remains guarded until
the following slices connect safe wave contexts.

Grounded non-escort hunter waves now use the captured constructor operation
before geometry selection. Wave values inherit rule defaults only at -1.
Initial ground timers above one keep retargeting outside the creation tick;
fresh/cache tests cover constructor metadata, ground countdown, lift and reload.
Airborne hunter creation and spawn escorts remain precisely guarded.

Airborne non-escort hunter waves now execute when existing craft and undelivered
craft transfers cannot supply a current or auto-patrol target. That structural
proof keeps the creation-tick path ordinary; later dispatch uses the loaded
hunter retarget capability. Rule-derived hunter percentage/mode/behavior and
fresh/cache creation/targeting reloads are covered. Candidate-bearing airborne
spawns and creation-time escorts retain the existing atomic wave boundary.

The constructor/spawn batch audit confirmed an empty hunter trajectory could
index its first waypoint before the existing minimum-length guard. Length and
altitude validation now precede hunter context checks. Empty/one-point regressions
assert an unchanged campaign and RNG, and a separate auto-patrol regression
checks that a possible same-tick relaunch cannot enter the no-candidate path.

The previous supply constructor-choice fixture now executes its formerly guarded
no-candidate hunter cases and asserts captured hunter flags, counts, live links
and reload. Objective supply ships still assert the default non-hunter
constructor. Mode/behavior capture draws now alternate so swapped draw order
cannot pass the shared canonical oracle comparison.

Final constructor/spawn cycle validation passes all 1,701 root tests with no
failures or skips, including checksums, private classifications, endurance and
populated allocation checks. Formatting verification, code-map validation and
diff checks pass. The reference checkout is clean and obsolete probe object
output was removed. The remaining 4c headless gate is open; 4d is untouched.

Airborne hunter waves now accept existing airborne craft ignored by the pinned Craft::isIgnoredByHK rule (low fuel or mission complete). Four captured truth-table rows and fresh/cache spawn reloads cover this extension; active targets remain guarded.

New airborne hunters also accept undetectable existing craft, which the pinned saved-order selection trace excludes before attraction evaluation. Fresh/cache tests assert the effective rule, non-hunting spawn and reload. Original targets retain their separate reference semantics; transferred craft remain conservative.

New flying hunter waves reserve their aggregate craft-scan work together with loaded retarget actors before the creation tick. A reproduced 1001-by-1001 workload previously threw after creation; it now blocks without state or RNG changes. The no-target structural scan is cached only for the current preflight/tick, keeping immediate chains bounded.

The fourth batch audit checks returning/undetectable exclusions and per-tick cache lifetime. An hourly-production reservation test covers the finite queue upper bound. Suspected multi-craft output undercount was rejected: runtime linking already enforces exactly one craft per production unit. No additional gameplay defect was confirmed in these three slices.

Final fourth-cycle validation passes all 1,710 root tests with zero failures or
skips. Fixture checksums, private-corpus classifications, 72-hour scenarios,
allocation budgets, formatting verification, code-map and diff checks pass.
The pinned C++ checkout remains clean, and obsolete capture object output was
removed. Branch 4c remains incomplete; branch 4d has not started.
