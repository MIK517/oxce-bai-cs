# World-owned research consequences

Branch 4c; reference `4df3a5e571a1a4b5e8a46d3161fb2e21a2adba15`.

## Research diary persistence (2026-10-08)

The shared research capability owns ordered diary occurrences and a monotonic
identity sequence in save-neutral snapshots. The adapter reads and writes
`researchDiary` entries with native `name`, unsigned 32-bit `date` components,
byte `sourceType` and `sourceName`. Missing source rules retain their names;
unrecognized byte-valued source kinds also survive. Removed research topics
are skipped before reading their entry payload, matching `SavedGame::load`.
Historical diary entries do not themselves grant research.

Native enum/source/entry structs from `ResearchDiary.h` are inserted verbatim
into `strategic-research-diary`; typed YAML collaborators capture 24 source/date
combinations. The topic-lookup collaborator models the inspected outer load
filter in `SavedGame.cpp`. Fresh/cache tests canonically compare all records
through three rewrites, including duplicate topics and removed source names.
Stable per-occurrence port keys preserve surviving unknown fields without
letting new or deleted occurrences inherit old sidecars. Removed topics with
conflicting sidecar keys cannot block a valid survivor's rewrite.

Missing required fields, negative/out-of-width numeric values, duplicate keys,
identity exhaustion/inconsistent sequences and populations above 100,000 fail
intentionally. Invalid snapshot restoration preserves the supplied RNG state.
All 28 diary/world-persistence tests pass. Captures remain useful; the obsolete
native object was removed. This slice owns persistence; automatic and
mission-source diary/grant execution remain the next slices. World expiry
research and unavailable event payloads retain their existing guards.

Reference methods: `ResearchDiaryEntry::load/save/setDate`,
`SavedGame::load`'s research-diary topic filter and `addResearchDiaryEntry`.
